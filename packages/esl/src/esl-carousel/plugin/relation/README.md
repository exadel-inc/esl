# ESL Carousel Relation Attribute

<a name="intro"></a>

The `esl-carousel-relate-to` is a custom attribute (mixin) for `ESLCarousel` that allows you to link multiple carousels together,
enabling them to synchronize their states. This is particularly useful for creating related carousels
that should move in unison, such as a thumbnail carousel that controls a main image carousel.
It is a carousel plugin, so it should be added directly to the `esl-carousel` element.

## Configuration

As `esl-carousel-relate-to` is a plugin, it uses the ESLCarousel plugin configuration system.
That means the only source of configuration is the `esl-carousel-relate-to` attribute value.
It supports ESLMedia query syntax to provide different configurations for different media conditions
(and it can be declared using tuple syntax, according to the `media` attribute).

The `esl-carousel-relate-to` attribute should be added to the carousel that needs to be synchronized with another carouselâ€”
in other words, the carousel that should follow the target carousel.
The plugin does not define two-way synchronization. If two-way synchronization is needed,
you should add the `esl-carousel-relate-to` attribute to both carousels, targeting each other.

The configuration properties of `esl-carousel-relate-to` are as follows:

### `target` (primary property, can be declared as the only value in the attribute)

Specifies the target carousel to sync with. Should be a selector string (supports ESLTraversingQuery syntax).
**Note:** An empty or `'none'` value will disable the relation plugin without any warning.

### `proactive` (optional)

Enables proactive relation mode. If set to `true`, the carousel will synchronize on animation start. Default is `false`.

## Example

A navigation carousel with thumbnails that controls the main image carousel:

```html
<div class="esl-carousel-nav-container">
  <esl-carousel id="main-carousel">
    <ul esl-carousel-slides>
      <li esl-carousel-slide><img src="big-img1.jpg" alt="Image 1"></li>
      <li esl-carousel-slide><img src="big-img2.jpg" alt="Image 2"></li>
      <li esl-carousel-slide><img src="big-img3.jpg" alt="Image 3"></li>
    </ul>
  </esl-carousel>
  <esl-carousel id="thumbnail-carousel" 
                count="4" 
                esl-carousel-relate-to="#main-carousel">
    <ul esl-carousel-slides>
      <li esl-carousel-slide esl-carousel-nav="slide:1"><img src="thumb1.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 1"></li>
      <li esl-carousel-slide esl-carousel-nav="slide:2"><img src="thumb2.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 2"></li>
      <li esl-carousel-slide esl-carousel-nav="slide:3"><img src="thumb3.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 3"></li>
    </ul>
  </esl-carousel>
</div>
```

**Note:** The `esl-carousel-nav` attribute is used to declare the navigation command for each slide in the thumbnail carousel.
The `esl-carousel-nav-target` attribute is omitted, only as it automatically finds the first `esl-carousel` element within the `.esl-carousel-nav-container` parent element.
