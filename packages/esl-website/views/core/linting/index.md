Welcome to the ESL linting hub. Here you can find:

- [ESL Shared ESLint Configuration & Migration Support](/core/linting/esl-eslint/) – unified flat config bundles (base / codestyle / medium / strict) plus built‑in deprecation & migration helper rules (aliases, paths, static members) with single severity control.
- [ESL Shared Stylelint Configuration](/core/linting/esl-stylelint/) – consistent styling and best practices for stylesheets.

Use this section as an entry point when configuring quality gates for projects relying on the Exadel Smart Library.
