ESL v5.7.0 is here!

This release introduces dynamic media condition support in `ESLMediaQuery` via the new `ESLMediaShortcuts` registry â€” 
allowing components to react to changing custom parameters in real time. 
As `ESLMediaQuery` powers nearly all ESL components, this unlocks more flexible and expressive behavior across the board. 
The update also includes minor stability fixes for `esl-carousel`, improving navigation logic and error handling.
