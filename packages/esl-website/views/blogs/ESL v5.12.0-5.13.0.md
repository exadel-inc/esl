ESL 5.13.0 is out now on npm – delivering a stronger carousel autoplay experience, smarter event type handling, and safer foundations across these two incremental releases.

- Carousel: refined autoplay engine (new interaction scope, smarter pause logic, resilient state machine) drives smoother, more controllable slide engagement.
- Content presentation: new `esl-line‑clamp` auto mode and tuple mask option.
- Developer & platform safety: new `@safe` decorator plus stricter typed event targets reduce edge‑case failures and improve diagnostics.
- Productivity & UX: autofocus prioritization in toggleable components and clearer media/query error handling lower friction in assembly and QA.
- Security & robustness: utilities hardened against prototype pollution; broader error handling and fallback behaviors reduce runtime risk.
