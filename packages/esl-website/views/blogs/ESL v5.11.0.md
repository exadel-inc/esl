ESL v5.11.0 is now available!

This release adds per‑slide autoplay timeouts for `esl-carousel` via the `esl-carousel-autoplay` plugin. It also fixes an incorrect slide‑move debug log when adding a slide via the JS API before it’s in the DOM.

We also merged the UI Playground codebase into the ESL monorepo. The package remains private; we’ll present it later once docs are moved to the ESL site and independent versioning is in place.
