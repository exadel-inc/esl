ESL v5.10.0 is now available!

This release introduces the new `esl-line-clamp` mixin, providing a clean solution for limiting text content within blocks. 
We've enhanced event handling with improved type support in `ESLEventUtils` and expanded our TypeScript utilities for better development experience.
The update also includes important fixes for `esl-carousel` wheel event handling and resolves missing event type definitions for custom event targets.
Additionally, we've updated our stylelint plugin dependency to version 4.0.0, which now requires stylelint 16.22.0 or higher for improved styling capabilities.
