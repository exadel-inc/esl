ESL v5.8.0 is now available on npm
This update adds built-in support for the `no-target` attribute in esl-tab and esl-trigger, 
which comes with a default hidden state for inactive tabs and triggers by default.
We've also introduced a public `ESL.version` property for easier diagnostics and tooling integration (make sure you include `lib.ts` to use it). 
Minor fixes improve carousel navigation flow and ESLint config compatibility.
