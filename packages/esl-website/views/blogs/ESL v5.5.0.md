The ESL Release v5.5.0 is now available on NPM.

This release introduces important new features for the ESL Carousel, including full support for the autoplay plugin 
and a new CSS renderer implementation that widens capabilities and rendering flexibility. 
Several bug fixes improve carousel plugins behavior, `esl-animate` repeat option handling, and time parsing.
