ESL 5.15.0 is out now on npm â€“ a light stability pass while we progress toward v6.

- Carousel: smarter navigation context ("current" marker + helper APIs) to simplify custom indicators and status UI.
- Popup: race condition fix for rapid open / close cycles improves reliability in dense interactive layouts.
- Docs & site polish: improved mobile table readability and spacing.

Forward look: work on the v6 major (including final removal of the deprecated standalone ESL plugin) continues; adopt the unified ESL ESLint config from 5.14+ to stay aligned.
