___ESLMedia___(`<esl-media>`) - a custom element, that provides an ability to add and configure media (video / audio) 
using a single tag as well as work with external providers using simple native-like API.

---

### Supported Features:
 
 - extendable `MediaProviders` implementation for different media types. Out-of-the-box support of:
   - HTMLAudio (`audio` type)
   - HTMLVideo (`video` type)
   - Youtube (`youtube` type)
   - Brightcove (`brightcove` type)
   - Abstract Iframe (`iframe` type)
 
 - `load-conditions` - restriction to load esl-media. Uses [ESLMediaQuery](https://exadel-inc.github.io/esl/utils/esl-media-query/) syntax.
 
 - `play-in-viewport` - feature that restricts active state to only visible components on the page.
 
 - `manual initialization` - component will not be initialized until `disable` marker is removed.
 
 - `group manager` - to allow single active player in group restriction.
 
 - `fill mode` - feature that allows managing player rendering option in bounds of given element area.
 
 - state change events (`esl:media:load`, `esl:media:error`, `esl:media:play`, etc).
 
 - provides 'HTMLMedia like' API that is safe and will be executed after real API is ready.

### Attributes:

 - `media-src` (for html media / iframe) - media resource src
 - `media-id` (for youtube/brightcove) - id of media resource
 - `media-type` - type of media provider
 
 - `group` (optional) - group name, only one media player can be active in bounds of the group
 
 - `ready-class` - class to add when the resource is ready
 - `ready-class-target` - [TraversingQuery](https://exadel-inc.github.io/esl/utils/esl-traversing-query/) to define a target for `ready-class`

 - `disabled` (boolean) - marker that prevents media api initialization
 
 - `fill-mode` (optional) - enables resource size management. Available options:
   - `auto` - default, media area will be stretched to element size
   - `cover` - media area will be zoomed in/out, cropped and centered to cover element area
   - `inscribe` - media area will be inscribed into element area
 
 - `aspect-ratio` (optional) - override aspect ratio for media resource. Supported formats:
   - `1.5` - width / height (`3:2` proportion in this example)
   - `16:9` - colon-separated proportion
   - `16/9` - slash-separated proportion

 - `play-in-viewport` (boolean) - auto stop media which is out of viewport area
 
 - `autofocus` (boolean) - set focus to the player when the media starts playing

 - `controls` (boolean) - show media player controls
 
 - `loop` (boolean) - play media in loop
 
 - `mute` (boolean) - mute media
 
 - `playsinline` (boolean) - allow playing media inline (media player will not request special control over device)
