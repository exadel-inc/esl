**ESLPopup** is a custom element used as a wrapper for content that can be displayed as a pop-up GUI element.
`ESLPopup` is based on `ESLToggleable` and works in pair with `ESLTrigger` that allows triggering ESLPopup instances state changes.

ESLPopup can only function correctly if it's placed directly inside the `document.body`. 
Therefore, when it connects to the DOM, it checks if it's in the body and, if it's not, 
it moves itself to the `document.body` and leaves an `ESLPopupPlaceholder` element in its place. 

### ESLPopup Attributes | Properties:

- `position` (string) - popup position relative to the trigger (currently supported: 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right' ) ('top' by default)
  
- `behavior` (string) - popup behavior if it does not fit in the window ('fit' by default). Available options:
  - `fit` - default, the popup will always be positioned in the right place. Position dynamically updates so it will
    always be visible
  - `fit-major` - same as fit, but position dynamically updates only on major axes. Looks like a flip in relation to the trigger
  - `fit-minor` - same as fit, but position dynamically updates only on minor axes. Looks like alignment to the arrow
  - empty or unsupported value - will not be prevented from overflowing clipping boundaries, such as the viewport
  
- `container` - defines container element ([ESLTraversingQuery](../esl-traversing-query/README.md) selector) to determinate bounds of popup visibility (window by default)
  
- `disable-activator-observation` (boolean) - disable hiding the popup depending on the visibility of the activator

- `arrow-class` - the class name of the element that is the popup's arrow (`esl-popup-arrow` by default)
  
- `margin-arrow` - margins on the edges of the arrow. This is the value in pixels that will be between the edge of the popup and the arrow at extreme positions of the arrow when offsetArrow is set to 0 or 100 (5 by default)
  
- `offset-arrow` - offset of the arrow as a percentage of the popup edge. 0% - at the left edge, 100% - at the right edge, for RTL it is vice versa (50 by default)

ESLPopup extends [ESLToggleable](../esl-toggleable/README.md) you can find other supported options in its documentation.

### Readonly Attributes

- `placed-at` (string) - popup updated position relative to the trigger. In other words, this is the real position of the popup relative to the trigger after the position update in the case when 'fit' behavior is enabled

### Styles

ESLPopup is a non-trivial component that calculates its position depending on user settings. So for styling, it would be advisable to use the basic styles that we provide with our library. You can easily override most of the rules from the base styles. Some properties are calculated, so you can't override them directly, but it is possible to set the value through CSS variables. For now, you can use the following variables:

- `--esl-popup-arrow-size` - arrow size (default '20px')
- `--esl-popup-background-color` - background color of the popup ('#fff' by default)
- `--esl-popup-border-color` - popup border color (default value is '#dbdbdb')
- `--esl-popup-border-width` - border width of the popup ('1px' by default)
- `--esl-popup-z-index` - z-index of the popup (default is '999')

Or if you are using the LESS preprocessor, you can optionally use mixins instead of CSS variables. However, we would recommend using the general approach with CSS variables.
