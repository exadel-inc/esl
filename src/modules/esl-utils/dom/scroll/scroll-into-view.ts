 * the element became visible to the user and scrolling stops.
 *
 * Note: Please, use the native element.scrollIntoView() if you don't need a promise
 * to detect the moment when the scroll is finished or you don't use smooth behavior.
 * @param element - element to be made visible to the user
 * @param options - scrollIntoView options
