**ESLToggleable** - a custom element, that is used as a base for "Popup-like" components creation.

`ESLToggleableDispatcher` - plugin component, that prevents activation of multiple `ESLToggleable` instances in bounds of managed container.
Usually (and by default) binds to `document.body`. Uses native DOM events to manage controlled instances state.

Use `ESLToggleableDispatcher.init()` to initialize (and bind) `ESLToggleableDispatcher`.
