# [ESL](../../../README.md) Panel & Panel Stack

Version: *2.0.0*.  

Authors: *Julia Murashko*.

ESLPanel is a custom element that is used as a wrapper for content that can be shown or hidden.
Can use collapsing/expanding animation (smooth height change).
Can be used in conjunction with ESLPanelGroup to control a group of ESLPopups

ESLPanelGroup is a custom element that is used as a container for a group of ESLPanels.
ESLPanelGroup provides group behaviour, such as synchronized content state change.

**Note:** ESLPanelGroup should be registered before ESLPanel.

```javascript
ESLPanelGroup.register();
ESLPanel.register();
```
