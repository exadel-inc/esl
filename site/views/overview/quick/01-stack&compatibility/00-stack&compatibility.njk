<h3 class="text-center mb-4">ESL is Tiny and Efficient</h3>

<p class="esl-animate-slide up" esl-animate="{repeat: true}">
  ESL is designed to work quickly and efficiently in browsers, minimizing unnecessary code and ensuring optimal website performance.
</p>

<p class="esl-animate-slide up" esl-animate="{repeat: true}">
  The ESL package is independent of third-party libraries, relying on built-in browser functionality like Web API and ECMAScript 6.
</p>

<p class="esl-animate-slide up" esl-animate="{repeat: true}">
  Written in TypeScript and compiled to ES6 JavaScript, ESLâ€™s codebase is fully tree-shakable, so your bundle includes only the components you use.
</p>

<p class="esl-animate-slide up text-note" esl-animate="{repeat: true}">
  Currently, ESL uses TypeScript decorators for some syntax sugar, with plans to complement these with native ES decorators in the future.
</p>
