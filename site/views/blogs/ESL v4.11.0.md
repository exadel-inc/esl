The ESL v4.11.0 has been released. The latest version brings the following updates:

- `ESLPanelGroup` now supports close state and provides correct animation for it
- New marker attribute for `ESLPanelGroup`: `has-opened` that indicates that the panel group has open panels inside
- Technical improvement for `isElement` checks across the library (ESL stable to DOM manipulation between different window contexts, e.g. iframes)
- New utility methods: `isElement` and `isPlainObject`
