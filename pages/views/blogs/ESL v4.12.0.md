ESL version 4.12.0 is now available on NPM. Explore the enhancements in the latest release:

- Introducing support for a new event target designed to detect touch swipe gestures (refer to [`ESLSwipeEventTarget`](/core/esl-event-listener/#-esleventutilswipe))
- `ESLMedia` now supports lazy initialization (refer to [`ESLMedia`](/components/esl-media) lazy attribute)
- Bug-Free Experience: `ESLTabs` now observes the resize of its content instead of observing the window resize event
- The structure of `esl-event-listener/core/targets` has been optimized, and now helpers are accessible with more consistent names
