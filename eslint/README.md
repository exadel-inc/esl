This article aims to assist the smooth migration process from older versions of ESL to the latest version. To support this transition, we have developed an ESLint plugin designed specifically for ESL library. This plugin targets deprecated features and aliases within the library, offering a seamless means of identifying these outdated elements. Additionally, it suggests suitable replacements, thereby ensuring a hassle-free upgrade to the newest version of ESL.

### Installation
To use custom ESLint plugin, you need to install it as a development dependency in your project. You can do this using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @exadel/eslint-plugin-esl
```

### Usage
To configure plugins inside of a configuration file, use the plugins key, which contains a list of plugin names:

```json
{
  // ...
  "plugins": [
    "@exadel/esl"
  ]
  // ...
}
```

Or in YAML:
```js
  plugins: 
    - "@exadel/esl"
```

Once you have added the plugin to your project, you can define specific ESLint rules for handling ESL deprecations in your ESLint configuration file. Here are some examples of how to configure them:

```json
{
  // ...
  "rules": {
    // Rule for deprecated `generateUId` alias for randUID
    "@exadel/esl/deprecated-4/generate-uid" : "warn", // warn | error

    // Rule for deprecated `deepCompare` alias for isEqual
    "@exadel/esl/deprecated-4/deep-compare" : "warn", // warn | error

    // Rule for deprecated `EventUtils` alias for ESLEventUtils
    "@exadel/esl/deprecated-4/event-utils" : "warn", // warn | error

    // Rule for deprecated `TraversingQuery` alias for ESLTraversingQuery
    "@exadel/esl/deprecated-4/traversing-query" : "warn", // warn | error

    // Rule for deprecated `ToggleableActionParams` alias for ESLToggleableActionParams
    "@exadel/esl/deprecated-4/toggleable-action-params" : "warn" // warn | error
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can choose whether to treat these deprecations as warnings or errors by setting the rule values to either `warn` or `error` as per your project's requirements.

Additionally, you can use the default settings provided by the plugin, where all rules are set to `warn` by extending the default configuration:

```json
{
  // ...
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@exadel/esl/default-4"
  ]
  // ...
}
```

Or set every rule to `error`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@exadel/esl/default-5"
  ]
  // ...
}
```

This will apply the recommended settings for handling ESL deprecations in your project.
